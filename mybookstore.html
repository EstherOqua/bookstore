            But these aren’t race-flipped versions of white, Western narratives: Babalola draws on Yoruba myth and religion, on folk tales told in Lesotho and Ghana, as well as the Ancient Greek myth of Eros and Psyche.

            “The point is, we don’t need to re-imagine known white stories with Black people and [people of colour],” she has said. “We have our own.”</summary>
